# Problem Analysis/Selection of Dataset (15%) [15]
## Distinction (Marks: 10.5 - 15)
- You have extensively identified, discussed, and evidenced the problem area.
- The datasets were not only appropriately selected but also examined with excellent rationale. 
- Your justification is thorough and insightful.
- The insights that could be extracted from these datasets were reasoned upon in an effective manner, showing a strong potential for meaningful analysis. 

## Commendation (Marks:9 - 10.35)
- You have correctly identified and discussed a problem area in an informed manner.
- The datasets were appropriately selected and examined. 
- Your justification for choosing these datasets is reasoned and coherent.
- You have thoughtfully considered the insights that could be extracted from these datasets, providing a well-rounded rationale for their inclusion.

## Pass (Marks: 7.5 - 8.85)
- You have faintly identified and discussed a problem area with some sound justification.
- The datasets selected are justified, though the explanation is somewhat slight but clear. 
- There is a clear but basic rationale provided.
- The potential insights that the datasets could provide are inadequately considered, suggesting that more thought is needed in linking data analysis to meaningful outcomes.

## Fail (Marks: 0 - 7.35)
- You have not discussed the core problem in a meaningful manner.
- The datasets selected lack sufficient justification or reasoning.
- The potential insights from analyzing these datasets were not elaborated upon, leaving the purpose of the analysis unclear

# Solution Produced (25%) [25]
## Distinction (Marks: 17.5 - 25)
- Your choice of technology is excellent and well-justified, showing a comprehensive understanding of the scenario's requirements and considering a broader scope beyond the immediate issue.
- An extensive range of alternative technologies were examined and included or excluded appropriately, reflecting a deep analysis.
- The solution is documented in an exemplary manner, with detailed control flows, pseudocode/script snippets, and software architecture diagrams that provide clear and thorough documentation.
- Scalability of the solution is extensively examined and justified, showcasing advanced planning and foresight. 

## Commendation (Marks:15 - 17.25)
- You have carefully examined and logically chosen the technology used for the solution, considering the requirements of the scenario in an informed manner.
- Alternative technologies were examined and appropriately excluded, showing a thorough decision-making process.
- The solution is well-documented, incorporating control flows and software architecture diagrams that enhance clarity and comprehension.
- Scalability of the solution is examined and justified, demonstrating foresight and planning.

## Pass (Marks: 12.5 - 14.75)
- The technology you used to produce the solution is sound given the requirements of the scenario. However, the rationale could be more robust.
- The solution is documented adequately, incorporating control flow diagrams which help in understanding the process.
- The utility of the solution is clearly examined and justified, though there is room for a deeper analysis of scalability.

## Fail (Marks: 0 - 12.25)
- Your justification for the choice of technology applied to the problem is very limited. It seems that the selection was made without adequate consideration of the scenario's requirements.
- The solution is inadequately documented, lacking necessary details and clarity.
Scalability is not justified or examined, and alternative technologies were not explored, indicating a need for a more comprehensive approach.

# Analysis/Insight from Data (20%) [20]
## Distinction (Marks: 14 - 20)
- Your approach to analysis is excellent, demonstrating advanced understanding and application of analytical techniques.
- The analysis was performed on multiple large datasets or a single massive dataset, ensuring robust data handling.
- The analysis is complex and provides nuanced insights, with advanced graphical visualizations such as maps that significantly enhance the communication of findings.

## Commendation (Marks: 12 - 13.8)
- You have taken a logical and informed approach to analysis.
- The analysis was performed on multiple large datasets or a single appropriately massive dataset, showing comprehensive data handling.
- The analysis is complex and provides nuanced insights, with tabular outputs and simple graphical representations that effectively communicate the findings.

## Pass (Marks: 10 - 11.8)
- A clear approach was taken to the analysis, which is commendable.
- The analysis was performed on a large dataset (or a representative sample), which is appropriate.
- The analysis is adequate and provides some insight, with basic graphs or tables included. However, more depth and complexity would enhance the results.

## Fail (Marks: 0 - 9.8)
- Limited analysis was attempted, and the outputs are weak or inadequate, providing little value.
- There is little or no justification for the analysis applied, making it difficult to understand the relevance and impact of the findings.
