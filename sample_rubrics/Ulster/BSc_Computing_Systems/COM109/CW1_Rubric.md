# Accessibility [20]

## 0 - 39% Marks (0-8)
  - The learner's web pages do not include essential accessibility features, making them challenging or impossible to use for individuals with disabilities.
  - There is no evidence of following accessibility guidelines, such as the use of ARIA roles, alt text for images, or keyboard navigation support.
  - The design decisions made by the learner make the site difficult to navigate for those with visual, auditory, or motor impairments.
  - Considerations such as color contrast, readable text size, and support for screen readers have been neglected.

## 50% - 60% Marks (10-12)
  - The learner has made some attempts to incorporate accessibility features, but they are not consistently applied.
  - The overall user experience may still present challenges for individuals with disabilities due to overlooked or incomplete implementation of key features like alt text or form labels.
  - Aspects like color contrast and keyboard accessibility are present but require significant improvement.

## 60% - 70% Marks (12-14) 
  - The learner has integrated accessibility considerations across most parts of the site, though some minor issues may still persist.
  - Most important features, such as alt text, ARIA roles, and form labels, have been included, though there may be occasional oversights.
  - Navigation and interaction on the site are generally inclusive, but there is room for refining and optimizing these features to meet higher accessibility standards.
  - Key areas like color contrast and text scalability are generally effective, though there may be some room for improvement.

## 70%+ Marks (14-20)
  - The learner has created web pages that fully comply with recognized accessibility standards, ensuring that the site can be easily used by all individuals, including those with disabilities.
  - Every detail, from alt text to ARIA roles and semantic HTML, has been thoughtfully applied, resulting in a seamless and inclusive user experience.
  - The site demonstrates excellent design choices for accessibility, including superior color contrast, scalable text, and support for screen readers and keyboard navigation.
  - The learner has clearly prioritized accessibility, making their web pages fully usable by individuals with a variety of disabilities.

# Validation [40]

## 0 - 39% Marks (0-16)
  - The learner's web form validation is either non-existent or severely flawed, allowing incorrect, incomplete, or even malicious data to be submitted.
  - There are no checks in place to ensure required fields are filled out correctly or that inputs meet expected formats, such as valid email addresses or phone numbers.
  - The form is vulnerable to security threats, with little to no protection against malicious inputs.

## 50% - 60% Marks (20-24)
  - The learner has implemented basic form validation, but it lacks robustness and may still allow some incorrect input, such as empty fields or improper formats.
  - Validation efforts are minimal, providing only basic checks, with some security vulnerabilities remaining unaddressed.
  - The error messages provided to users may be unclear or not very helpful in guiding them to correct their mistakes.

## 60% - 70% Marks (24-28)
  - The learner's form validation is generally effective, with most incorrect inputs being flagged appropriately.
  - The form handles most validation scenarios, but there may still be some minor issues or opportunities for improvement.
  - Error messages are helpful and provide users with guidance on correcting input errors, though there may be room for increased clarity or user-friendliness.
  - Basic protections are in place against malicious inputs, but there may be some areas where security could be enhanced.

## 70%+ Marks (28-40)
  - The learner has implemented comprehensive and robust form validation that thoroughly checks for correct data entry, ensuring that required fields are filled out and input formats are accurate.
  - The form effectively prevents incorrect or incomplete submissions and is highly secure against potential threats, such as injection attacks.
  - Error messages are clear, informative, and easy for users to understand, guiding them in correcting any mistakes.
  - The learner has demonstrated a strong understanding of form validation, ensuring both data integrity and security.


# Code Quality [30]
