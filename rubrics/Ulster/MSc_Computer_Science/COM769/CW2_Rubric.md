# Problem Definition and Discussion (10%) [10]
## Distinction (Marks: 7 - 10)
- Clear, concise and well-articulated problem statement tailored to a real-world use case.
- Strong rationale for scalability needs backed by practical deployment challenges.
- Demonstrates an advanced understanding of scalable system demands through the discussion.
## Commendation (Marks: 6 - 6.9)
- Good identification of the core problem and why a scalable approach is appropriate.
- Justifies the use of scalable technologies and deployment methods in a relevant context.
## Pass (Marks: 5 - 5.9)
- Describes the problem sufficiently but lacks deeper engagement with scalability drivers.
- Some effort to relate problem context to scalable technologies, though more depth is needed.
## Fail (Marks: 0 - 4.9)
- Problem is either not clearly defined or lacks connection to the theme of scalability.
- No meaningful justification for applying scalable design or related practices.

# Overview of Technical Solution Developed (15%) [15]
## Distinction (Marks: 10.5 - 15)
- Demonstrates comprehensive planning, showcasing system components and their interactions.
- Explores architectural decisions with clear rationale and documentation (diagrams, flows).
- Identifies potential alternatives and justifies chosen technologies with pros/cons analysis.
## Commendation (Marks: 9 - 10.4)
- Provides a well-organised technical overview with architectural visuals.
- Chosen technologies are well-explained and show good alignment with project needs.
## Pass (Marks: 7.5 - 8.9)
- Includes key components of the solution and basic architecture.
- Some rationale for choices is given, but lacks depth or alternative exploration.
## Fail (Marks: 0 - 7.4)
- Solution overview is vague or incomplete.
- Missing architecture or unjustified technology choices; integration points unclear.

# Application of Advanced Features (20%) [20]
## Distinction (Marks: 14 - 20)
- Integrates multiple advanced features like media analysis, CI/CD, or identity control.
- Seamless integration that elevates user experience or system performance.
- Each feature is explained, justified, and demonstrated with functional outcomes.
## Commendation (Marks: 12 - 13.9)
- Two advanced features used with clear purpose and functional integration.
- Solid technical reasoning for their inclusion and good implementation detail.
## Pass (Marks: 10 - 11.9)
- One relevant feature added and shown to work effectively.
- Some explanation given but may lack clarity or completeness in execution.
## Fail (Marks: 0 - 9.9)
- Features are missing, irrelevant, or poorly executed.
- Implementation may be superficial or non-functional.

# Assessment of Limitations and Scalability (20%) [20]
## Distinction (Marks: 14 - 20)
- Provides thoughtful analysis of bottlenecks, trade-offs, and system limits.
- Proposes well-reasoned strategies to improve scalability and resilience.
- Demonstrates knowledge of real-world scaling scenarios and mitigation planning.
## Commendation (Marks: 12 - 13.9)
- Covers main limitations and presents some mitigation strategies.
- Scalability considerations are detailed with technical solutions applied.
## Pass (Marks: 10 - 11.9)
- Some mention of solution limitations and basic scaling approach.
- Improvement strategies may be minimal or vague.
## Fail (Marks: 0 - 9.9)
- Lacks meaningful insight into limitations.
- Scalability either ignored or described at a surface level only.

# Concluding Comments (5%) [5]
## Distinction (Marks: 3.5 - 5)
- Final thoughts critically reflect on project strengths, weaknesses, and learning outcomes.
- Suggests clear improvements or next steps for enhancing the solution.
## Commendation (Marks: 3 - 3.4)
- Thoughtful reflection with mention of areas to improve.
- Good awareness of what was done well and what could be built upon.
## Pass (Marks: 2.5 - 2.9)
- Some reflective content; limited exploration of challenges faced or future work.
## Fail (Marks: 0 - 2.4)
- Concluding thoughts missing or too brief to add meaningful value.

# Video Demonstration (25%) [25]
## Distinction (Marks: 17.5 - 25)
- Video clearly explains the full flow of the application, backend interaction, and cloud deployment.
- Smooth transitions and real-time demonstrations of all key functionalities.
- All advanced features are shown working and performance is stable.
## Commendation (Marks: 15 - 17.4)
- Most parts of the system demonstrated effectively.
- Video includes commentary or indicators explaining functionality.
## Pass (Marks: 12.5 - 14.9)
- Functionality presented, but some components may be missing or poorly explained.
- Minor technical issues present but don't hinder the overall message.
## Fail (Marks: 0 - 12.4)
- Application is non-functional or video lacks clarity.
- Technical implementation not shown or explained adequately.

# Referencing (5%) [5]
## Distinction (Marks: 3.5 - 5)
