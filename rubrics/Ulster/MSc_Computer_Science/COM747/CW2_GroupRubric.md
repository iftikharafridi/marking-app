# Overview of Domain and Existing Work [10]
## Distinction (7 – 10 marks):
- The learner demonstrates an excellent understanding of the problem domain, clearly articulating the project’s context, significance, aim, and objectives.
- The abstract is concise, informative, and effectively summarises the purpose and findings of the work.
- The introduction sets a compelling background, outlining research motivation and scope.
- The literature review is comprehensive, critically engages with high-quality academic sources, identifies research gaps, and supports the rationale for the project.
- Referencing is accurate and follows IEEE or a similar style.

## Commendation (6 – 6.9 marks):
- The learner demonstrates a good understanding of the domain and presents a clear aim and objectives.
- The abstract and introduction are well written and appropriately structured.
- The literature review includes relevant sources, though may lack some depth or critical engagement.
- Referencing is mostly consistent and accurate.

## Pass (5 – 5.9 marks):
- The learner provides a basic understanding of the domain with general articulation of objectives.
- The abstract and introduction are present but may lack structure or insight.
- The literature review is limited, with minimal critical analysis or academic depth.
- Referencing may contain minor formatting issues or inconsistencies.

## Fail (0 – 4.9 marks):
- The learner shows little understanding of the domain, with unclear or missing aims and objectives.
- The abstract or introduction is weak, unclear, or missing.
- There is little or no literature review, or it includes irrelevant/poor sources.
- Referencing is poorly structured or absent.

# Methodology and Results [20]
## Distinction (14 – 20 marks):
- The learner provides an excellent rationale for the choice of statistical and machine learning methods.
- Advanced analysis techniques are used to explore and characterise the dataset.
- Data cleaning, transformation, and wrangling are handled with care and precision.
- The experimental design is innovative and clearly aligned with the project objectives.
- Results are well interpreted and critically evaluated using appropriate performance metrics (e.g. accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, RMSE).
- There is strong evidence of benchmarking and comparative analysis.
- High-quality visualisations and tables are used effectively to enhance clarity.

## Commendation (12 – 13.8 marks):
- The learner justifies the methods chosen and applies appropriate data analysis and modelling techniques.
- The design is clearly laid out, though may lack advanced experimentation or benchmarking.
- Evaluation is good and demonstrates understanding of the model’s strengths and limitations.
- Visuals and tables support the narrative effectively, though with room for improvement.

## Pass (10 – 11.8 marks):
- The learner presents a basic methodology, though rationale may be limited.
- Use of statistics and machine learning is functional but lacks sophistication or innovation.
- Evaluation is present but not comprehensive.
- Visuals are included but may be simplistic or poorly explained.

## Fail (0 – 9.8 marks):
- The methodology is unclear or inappropriate for the task.
- Limited or incorrect use of data analysis or modelling techniques.
- Results are inadequately presented with little or no critical evaluation.
- Graphs or tables are missing, incorrect, or poorly designed.

# Effective Communication, Discussion, Conclusions, and References [10]
## Distinction (7 – 10 marks):
- The learner presents results in a logical, structured and highly professional manner.
- There is clear and insightful discussion of outcomes, with recognition of limitations and implications.
- Conclusions are well-supported by findings and reflect critical understanding.
- References are of high quality, well-integrated into the text, and correctly formatted.
- The document layout is clear, professional, and follows the IEEE structure closely.

## Commendation (6 – 6.9 marks):
- The discussion is meaningful and conclusions are appropriate.
- Limitations are acknowledged, though discussion may lack critical depth.
- Most references are relevant and properly cited.
- The structure and flow are good with only minor issues in layout or formatting.

## Pass (5 – 5.9 marks):
- The learner attempts to discuss the results and draw conclusions, though these may be superficial or disconnected.
- Referencing is adequate but inconsistent.
- The report layout may lack clarity or polish.

## Fail (0 – 4.9 marks):
- The learner presents little or no meaningful discussion or conclusion.
- Referencing is poor or missing.
- The structure is unclear and lacks academic coherence.

# Professional, Ethical, Social, and Sustainability Issues [10]
## Distinction (7 – 10 marks):
- The learner demonstrates strong awareness of legal, ethical, and social issues throughout the project lifecycle.
- The project addresses data privacy, fairness, bias mitigation, and responsible AI practices.
- Equality, diversity, inclusion, and sustainability considerations are embedded in both process and delivery.
- Evidence of reflection on professional conduct and trustworthy systems is clear and comprehensive.

## Commendation (6 – 6.9 marks):
- The learner considers key ethical and professional responsibilities, with a reasonable focus on inclusion and sustainability.
- Most relevant issues are addressed, though may lack practical implementation or critical depth.

## Pass (5 – 5.9 marks):
- The learner mentions ethical or social considerations, though may not fully explain or apply them.
- Coverage of inclusion or sustainability is limited.

## Fail (0 – 4.9 marks):
- The submission ignores or poorly addresses ethical, legal or social concerns.
- Sustainability, diversity, and equality are overlooked.
