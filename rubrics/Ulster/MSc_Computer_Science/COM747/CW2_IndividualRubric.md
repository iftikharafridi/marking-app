# Short Overview of the Project [10]
## Distinction (7 – 10 marks):
- The learner provides a clear and concise overview of the data science project, demonstrating an excellent grasp of its context, objectives, and significance.
- The main steps of the project lifecycle are highlighted, including dataset selection, processing, modelling, and evaluation.
- The overview is structured, insightful, and aligns well with the group’s overall research direction.

## Commendation (6 – 6.9 marks):
- The learner presents a good overview with clarity on project goals and structure.
- Some parts may need deeper explanation or clearer delivery.

## Pass (5 – 5.9 marks):
- The overview is basic, with limited structure or coherence.
- Key project stages may be mentioned without sufficient context or explanation.

## Fail (0 – 4.9 marks):
- The project overview is unclear or absent.
- The learner fails to demonstrate understanding of the broader scope of the project.

# Individual Contribution and Technical Implementation [30]
