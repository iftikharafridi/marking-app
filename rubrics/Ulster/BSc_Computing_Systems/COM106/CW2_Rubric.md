# Database Design (30%) [30]
## Fail (0 - 12 Marks)
- No ER diagram or very limited ER diagram which does not represent the business scenario.
- No cardinality ratios discussed or no justification of the presented cardinality ratios.
- No participation constraints discussed or no justification of the presented participation constraints.
- No Relational schema is presented or it is presented but no PKs or FKs are evidenced.
- Tables are not in 3NF. No justification for any additional tables/attributes.
- Overview of data types is incomplete. No justifications provided for chosen data types.
- No tables are in 3NF, and descriptions provided for each are limited.
- Assumptions for the modelling process are not provided or not at all relevant.

## Pass (12 - 15 Marks)
- ER diagram is presented but it might not be fully representative of the business scenario and does not correctly present all cardinality ratios or participation constraints.
- Cardinality ratios are discussed but the justification is barely adequate and in some cases incorrect.
- Participation constraints are discussed but the justification is barely adequate and in some cases incorrect.
- Relational schema is presented but it might not evidence FKs or they might not be in the optimal tables. 
- Tables might not all be in 3NF.
- Any additional tables/attributes are not sufficiently justified.
- All data types and necessary justifications are discussed. Not all justifications are logical or optimized.

- Assumptions for the modelling process are basic and only somewhat relevant.

## Good (15 - 18 Marks)
- ER diagram presented with acceptable representation of the business scenario.
- All cardinality ratios and participation constraints are clear from the diagram alone, but some may not be correct.
- All cardinality ratios are discussed, and their justification is acceptable.
- All participation constraints are discussed, and their justification is acceptable.
- Relational schema is acceptable. PKs and FKs are indicated, but more optimal attributes or tables could have been selected for some FKs.
- Tables in schema are in 3NF.
- Any additional tables/attributes have acceptable justifications.
- All data types and necessary justifications are discussed. Justifications are acceptable, but some choices of data types or data lengths could be improved.
- All tables are in 3NF, and descriptions provided for each are acceptable.
- Assumptions for the modelling process are acceptable and sufficiently relevant.

## Commendation (18 - 20 Marks)
- ER diagram is presented, and its representation of the business scenario is good.
- All cardinality ratios and participation constraints are clear from the diagram alone, and they each correctly represent the business scenario.
- All cardinality ratios are discussed, and their justification is of good quality.

- Relational schema is presented and is of good quality.
- Good selection of PKs and FKs, including the tables the FKs are placed in.

- Assumptions for the modelling process are good and completely relevant.
